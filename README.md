## MVC Arquitecture 

MovieReviews application doesn't require a lot of attention on front end, complexity only  lies  on the back end side of this application. Therefore, an
MVC arquitecture seems to be the best option in this case. 

Modelos devidamente configurados para o entity framework para não faltar nenhuma configuração adicional ou qualquer erro pelo entity,
